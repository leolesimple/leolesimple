## 👋 Hey, I’m **Léo Lesimple**!  

🚀 **MMI student @ IUT de Marne-la-Vallée (Champs-sur-Marne)**  
🎨 **Passionate about Web Development & UI/UX Design**  
🍏 **Apple enthusiast – If it’s sleek, intuitive, and well-designed, I’m into it.**  

💡 **What I do:**  
- Building **modern, functional, and user-friendly web experiences**  
- Designing **intuitive UIs** that enhance usability and accessibility  
- Exploring **mobility solutions** for Île-de-France with **[InfoStation (👀 available soon)](https://infostation.fr)**, a project designed to make public transit data more accessible and useful.  

💻 **Bridging technology and design**  
I’m passionate about crafting digital experiences that aren’t just visually appealing but also **practical and intuitive**. Whether it’s a **high-performance website, a sleek UI, or a mobility platform**, I love blending **design, data, and code** to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working with **modern web technologies** to build seamless and efficient solutions.  

🎨 **Design & Adobe Creative Suite**  
While my main focus is on **UI/UX with Figma**, I also have experience with the **Adobe Creative Suite** (*Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Premiere Pro*). From **graphic design to motion graphics and editorial layouts**, I use these tools to enhance my projects—though I wouldn’t call myself a full-fledged Adobe expert.  

🚆 **Fascinated by French trains & urban transit**  
MI 09, Z 58000, MP 14… If it’s innovative, efficient, and shaping the future of mobility, I’m all in. The complexity of these networks, moving **millions of people daily at insane frequencies**, is just as fascinating as the trains themselves. Understanding how everything works behind the scenes? That’s the kind of challenge I love—especially when **tech, data, and design** come into play.  

💡 **Soft skills:**  
💭 **Curious & detail-oriented** – Always diving deep and refining every aspect.  
🛠️ **Independent & structured** – I handle projects with efficiency and precision.  
🎤 **Comfortable speaking & presenting** – Explaining ideas and pitching projects? I’m on it.
